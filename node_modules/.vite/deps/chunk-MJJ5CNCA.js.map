To do this, we use a cascading rounding algorithm to ensure that the sum of the widths is maintained\n * while distributing the rounding remainder across the columns.\n *\n * As noted in the chrome source code, this algorithm is very accurate, but has the potential to be quadratic.\n * They have deemed this to be acceptable because the number of elements is usually small and the flex factors\n * are usually not high variance.

It works by rendering the React tree into a\n// Portal to a fake DOM implementation. This gives us efficient access to the tree of rendered objects, and\n// supports React features like composition and context. We use this fake DOM to access the full set of elements\n// before we render into the real DOM, which allows us to render a subset of the elements (e.g. virtualized scrolling),\n// and compute properties like the total number of items. It also enables keyboard navigation, selection, and other features.\n// React takes care of efficiently rendering components and updating the collection for us via this fake DOM.\n//\n// The DOM is a mutable API, and React expects the node instances to remain stable over time. So the implementation is split\n// into two parts. Each mutable fake DOM node owns an instance of an immutable collection node. When a fake DOM node is updated,\n// it queues a second render for the collection. Multiple updates to a collection can be queued at once. Collection nodes are\n// lazily copied on write, so only the changed nodes need to be cloned. During the second render, the new immutable collection\n// is finalized by updating the map of Key -> Node with the new cloned nodes. Then the new collection is frozen so it can no\n// longer be mutated, and returned to the calling component to render.\n\n/**\n * A mutable node in the fake DOM tree.
